Aircheck - EnLife

EnLife is a platform to crowd-source information that can be used to help people inform about their health issues, mainly about
symptoms and allergies affected by enviromental changes in the air, such as temperature, relative humidity, air pollution etc.
There are many countries in the world where health care system is not developed and as a result, a lot of patients don't know how to handle this sort of problem.
Our platform is consised of 4 parts. The first one is the introduction, where the users can inform about the aim of this platform. The second part is the map with NASA 
provided data about the affection by a certain disease or pollution within a certain area. Also users will be able to search about a certain symptoms and location to check what are thay 
caused by. And in the end there is a list of doctors-volunteer and how thay can be contacted.
